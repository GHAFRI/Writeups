I haven't seen a programming language like this before. EncryptedVB???

Flag is in format: flag{...}
```

## Solution

We were given an `EncryptedVB.vbe` that we needed to decrypt, so we just used a [VBS decrypter] (https://master.ayra.ch/vbs/vbs.aspx) to decrypt it to `.vbs` and then we just opened in `Notepad` we find the flag `flag{Encrypted_VBscript__What_a_Country}`

### What I learned

Nothing, very easy.
