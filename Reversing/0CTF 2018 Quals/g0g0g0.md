mdZero says that he has tons of excellent tools. However, he has never showed his magic to us before. 
"They are all stored in my mobile HDD. At home, not here". That's what he told us when we were asking, every time! 
Once, we forced him to tell us, or he would be sent to cops. 
Then he take out [this one](https://github.com/GHAFRI/Writeups/blob/master/Reversing/0CTF%202018%20Quals/g0g0g0.tar.gz) from his pocket. 
Could you help me to figure out what is it?

To verify your answer, please visit: 

`nc 202.120.7.206 13337`

## Under Progress:

So we checked the `trace.log` file and we find that its just a trace file for `golang` of the file `gogo.go`
Without any leads of how to understand what is going on in this file we check `nc 202.120.7.206 13337`
It gives us

```
sha256(XXXX+ZXhraa4di29iwSSH) == 90ba2f0303491d93b769ae06bdc85d61af7c62bb9cc6ea6224e892753c25d1a9
Give me XXXX ([A-Za-z0-9]{4}, please do not ends with "\n"):
```
This basically tell us that we have to input 4 characters as the XXXX which can be added to `ZXhraa4di29iwSSH` which then is encrypted to
`90ba2f0303491d93b769ae06bdc85d61af7c62bb9cc6ea6224e892753c25d1a9`

The `ZXhraa4di29iwSSH` and `90ba2f0303491d93b769ae06bdc85d61af7c62bb9cc6ea6224e892753c25d1a9` are always random everytime we try to run it so we wrote a python code to figure out the `key`

```
import hashlib
from itertools import product
from string import ascii_letters, digits

for i in product(ascii_letters + digits, repeat=4):
    key = ''.join(i)
    str = hashlib.sha256(key + "ZXhraa4di29iwSSH").hexdigest()
    if str == "90ba2f0303491d93b769ae06bdc85d61af7c62bb9cc6ea6224e892753c25d1a9":
        print key

```

Then we generate new hashes and replace them in the code as soon as we run the `nc` to get the `key`. Once we generate the correct `key` for the `XXXX` we input that in the terminal and we get

`Input 3 numbers`

and the program exits.

We found that string in the `trace.log` file but we cant seem to understand or read the trace file.
