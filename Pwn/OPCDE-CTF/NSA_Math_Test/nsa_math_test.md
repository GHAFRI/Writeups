Public key crypto is built on the inability to factor large relative primes quickly. Given a relative prime N, find the two prime numbers whose product is N. Submit solutions as a space-separated pair, for example:

9001 9187

The service is at services.opcde-ctf.propervilla.in on port 10010/tcp.

Flag is in format: flag{...}

Hint: Try first connecting manually to the service, e.g:

$ nc -v services.opcde-ctf.propervilla.in 10010

```
