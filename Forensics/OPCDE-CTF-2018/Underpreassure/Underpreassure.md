# Under Pressure - 100
```
I have been asked to explain the difference between encoding and compression in a job interview. 
I guess people confuse the two?

Flag is in format: flag{...}
```

## Solution

As simple as this problem is, we are given a `Txt` file with a `Base64` text
```

```
We convert it ASCII and we get
```
Nice work decoding this. Things still feel a little compressed.
XcompressedKILv-(2..4»ãOswK6HsOJOts3.2+/K7	4
```
It seems like a `file code`, so we take `decode` it again, but this time into a `.bin` file and we open it in to `HxD` we get
```
.‚Äπ..¬∑.√ùX..compressed.K√ãIL¬Øv√é√è-(2..√é4√à‚ÄπO√ås‚Ä∞w√çK6H√â√ås.O.J.O√âts3.2√é+‚Ä∞/√â√à√¥K7.√•...¬ø..4...
```
`.<.` is a file signature for a `gzip` compression, so we change `.bin` to `.gz` and we open it.
We find a file and in that file we get the flag
```
Thanks for playing CTF.  
Capturing flags is fun!  Here is your flag:  flag{b33p_b00p_sh00p_da_wh00p}
```

### What I learned 

Never copy file formats from a decoder directly to a hex editor.
Let that decoder convert directly to a file for you so you dont lose important variables such as `<` which could correupt your files.
